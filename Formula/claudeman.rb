  def install
    # Install main script
    bin.install "claudeman"

    # Install lib files to share directory
    (share/"claudeman/lib").install Dir["lib/*"]
  end

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      To use claudeman, run from any project directory:
        claudeman run

      For audio notifications (macOS only), start the listener:
        node #{share}/claudeman/lib/listener.js

      First run will install Go and development tools into the container.
      Subsequent runs reuse installed tools for faster startup.

      Configuration:
        Hooks are merged into .claude/settings.json on each run.
        Customize per-project by editing .claude/settings.json.
        Your customizations are preserved during hook updates.
